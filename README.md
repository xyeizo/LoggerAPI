LoggerAPI is a robust, customizable logging library designed for .NET applications. It facilitates easy, asynchronous logging to both consoles and files, supporting various log levels and custom formatting options.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Logging**: Ensures that logging operations do not block the main application flow.
- **Dual Output**: Allows logging to both the console and to files simultaneously.
- **Log Level Filtering**: Control which log messages are recorded by setting the minimum log level.
- **Customizable Formats**: Supports customization of log formats, including optional watermarks.
- **Concurrency Safe**: Utilizes concurrent queues and semaphore locks to handle logs from multiple threads safely.
